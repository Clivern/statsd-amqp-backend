<p align="left">A Pluggable backend for <a href="https://github.com/statsd/statsd">StatsD</a> to publish metrics to RabbitMQ. So instead of polling our data store for changes on metrics, We will get notified when there is a change through RabbitMQ.</p>

## Installation

Create config file `config.js` like the following

```js
{
  graphitePort: 2003
, graphiteHost: "graphite.example.com"
, port: 8125
, backends: [ "./backends/graphite" ]
}
```

Run `statsd` daemon with that config file

```
$ git clone https://github.com/statsd/statsd.git
$ node stats.js /path/to/config.js
```

Start sending metrics

```
$ echo "foo:1|c" | nc -u -w0 127.0.0.1 8125
```
